        <details>
            A man named Steve breaks into a mine to discover the Orb of dominance and the Earth Crystal and he uses them to enter the overworld.
             Steve builds a paradise all for himself, when he stumbles across a portal which transports him to the Nether. 
             Whilst in the Nether, Steve is seized by the Piglin leader named Malgosha. <br>
             In the present day, a man named Garrett "the garbage man" wins a contest and opens up his own game store. 
             One day, Garrett receives an eviction notice and goes out to find some stuff to sell for money, including the contents 
             of Steve's old house. In his search for items, Garrett comes across both the orb and the Earth Crystal. Meanwhile, Henry 
             and Natalie have recently lost their parents and have moved to Idaho and they meet with a real estate agent who wants to 
             open their own petting zoo. Unfortunately,  Henry is told off on his first day of school after his jetpack goes
              haywire and knocks over a mascot on top of a potato chip factory. <br>
              he five friends craft an arsenal of weapons along with a group of Iron Golems and plan to fight Piglin back. Malgosha
               tries several surprise attacks on Steve, but ultimately dies and the quintet arrive back at the Earth Portal, before
                Steve hands Dennis over to Dawn. Back on Earth, the five become quite successful and create their own video game 
                called Block City Battle Buddies, whilst Dawn opens a zoo with Dennis, Natalie teaches self defense, Henry finally 
                accomplishes building his jetpack and Steve and Garrett make music together in Garrett's store. Steve returns to his old 
              home in the real world to collect a chest he'd left in the attic, when he met with the current owner of the house, a 
              woman named Alex. <br>
