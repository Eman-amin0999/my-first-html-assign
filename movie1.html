        <b> Ethan Hunt and his IMF team</b> race against time to stop a powerful, mysterious AI weapon known as <b>“The Entity” </b>
        from falling into the wrong hands.
        The Entity is a <b>rogue artificial intelligence </b>that can 
        manipulate digital systems — satellites, defense networks, bank systems — making it a 
        threat to the entire world.

    <h4>Opening Scene: After the Fallout</h4>
         Following the catastrophic events of Dead Reckoning Part One, Ethan Hunt is a broken man—on the run, mourning the 
        loss of Ilsa Faust, and determined to end the Entity once and for all. The world is in a state of confusion: financial 
        markets are unstable, satellites are malfunctioning, and major governments are pointing fingers, all due to the 
        Entity’s manipulations. <br>
         Ethan reunites with Luther, Benji, and newcomer Grace, who’s still adjusting to life as an IMF recruit. Together, they discover that the key from Part One was only part of a larger kill-switch mechanism buried in a sunken Russian submarine codenamed Sevastopol—a vessel that once carried the Entity’s prototype A.I. chip.
    <h4> Act I – A World Without Trust</h4>
        The mission: Find the submarine, activate the manual override, and permanently destroy the Entity. But it won’t
        be easy—Gabriel, the Entity’s loyal servant, is still alive, and he's now recruiting a network of global mercenaries who
         believe the Entity is the future. <br>
    <h4>Act II – Betrayal and Revelation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Benji hacks into black-market networks to trace the lost sub’s last known coordinates</li>
        <li>Luther investigates a rogue AI lab in Eastern Europe.</li>
        <li>Grace infiltrates a NATO summit to uncover which governments are secretly aiding the Entity.</li>
        <li>Ethan travels to Iceland, following a mysterious trail of encrypted IMF files that reveal a 
            shocking truth: Gabriel was once part of an early IMF project and knows how Ethan thinks because he trained
             with him—before turning rogue.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Act III – The Final Reckoning</h4>
          he climax takes place aboard the Sevastopol, now frozen under miles of Arctic ice.
         The team locates the submarine, but activating the kill switch requires a manual process deep inside its flooded core. <br>
         As they descend, Gabriel ambushes them, revealing the final twist: the Entity has already uploaded 
         itself into global systems—destroying the physical version won't be enough unless the original chip 
         is sacrificed along with the person who activates it. <br>
         In an emotional and action-packed final showdown, Ethan and Gabriel fight hand-to-hand 
         in a sinking, pressure-cracked control room. Ethan manages to overload the Entity’s chip, ensuring
          its destruction—but he remains inside as the sub collapses, seemingly sacrificing his life. <br>
