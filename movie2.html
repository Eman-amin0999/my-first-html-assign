        <h3> About Movie </h3>
        <p>
            The movie tells the story of Sonny Hayes (played by Brad Pitt), a former Formula 1 driver
             who once had a promising career but left the sport after a serious crash and internal team conflicts.
              Years later, he is invited back to mentor a rising young driver, Joshua Pearce (played by Damson Idris), on a fictional
               F1 team called APX GP.Sonny returns not only as a mentor but also gets a second chance to race alongside
                the current generation of elite F1 drivers. The film explores themes of redemption, legacy, and the intense 
                mental and physical pressure of racing at the highest level.
