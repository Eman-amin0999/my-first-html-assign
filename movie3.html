            About Movie 
        </h3>
        Set five years after the events of Jurassic World: Dominion, the Earth has changed. Due to rapid 
         climate shifts, habitat loss, and disease outbreaks, most dinosaur species have either died out or
          been driven into a few isolated equatorial regions, where they continue to evolve in secret. <br>

          A powerful pharmaceutical corporation, desperate to find a breakthrough treatment for a growing global
           heart disease crisis, believes the answer may lie in the unique biology of three massive dinosaurs:
           <ul>
            <li> The Titanosaurus (land)</li>
            <li> The Mosasaurus (sea)</li>
            <li> The Quetzalcoatlus (air)</li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            To retrieve samples from these ancient giants, the company assembles a covert expedition led
             by Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson), a former military specialist with a history of success in extreme rescue missions. 
            Alongside her are mercenaries, biologists, and survival experts — but none of them are truly prepared for what awaits. <br>
