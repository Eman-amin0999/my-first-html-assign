    <h3> About Movie </h3>
     <p>
    A tale of a young girl's close encounter with the galaxy's most wanted extraterrestrial. 
    Lilo is a lonely Hawaiian girl who adopts a small ugly "dog," whom she names Stitch. Stitch would be the perfect
     pet if he weren't in reality a genetic experiment who has escaped from an alien planet and crash-landed on Earth. 
     Through her love, faith and unwavering belief in ohana, the Hawaiian concept of family, Lilo helps unlock Stitch's
      heart and gives him the ability to care for someone else. <br>
      The film tells the story of two individuals - an orphaned Hawaiian girl named Lilo Pelekai, who
       is raised by her struggling older sister, Nani, after their parents' deaths, and the genetically 
      engineered extraterrestrial creature Experiment 626, whom Lilo adopts as her "dog" and renames "Stitch".
